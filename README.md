## Notes

If using an ASG capacity provider the instances will require external network access to communicate with the Amazon ECS service. This can be acheieved by either setting `cp_associate_public_ip_address` to true to associate public ip addresses to the instances or by using either network address translation (NAT) or PrivateLink to establish the connection.
